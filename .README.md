\# KidRa: Egypt Tourism Data Analytics for the Next Generation



\## ☀️ The Name: Why "KidRa"?

The name \*\*KidRa\*\* is a symbolic blend of two worlds:

\* \*\*KID:\*\* Represents our core focus—the children and the next generation of travelers.

\* \*\*RA (رع):\*\* Named after the ancient Egyptian \*\*Sun God\*\*, the king of the gods and the father of creation.

Just as Ra brought light to ancient Egypt, \*\*KidRa\*\* aims to shine a light on the untapped potential of children's tourism in the land of the Pharaohs.



\## 🏙️ Project Scope

\*\*KidRa\*\* is a data science initiative aimed at analyzing and validating the market potential for children-centric tourism in Egypt. By leveraging historical tourism data (2015-2025) and demographic analysis, this project identifies critical market gaps and validates the target audience for specialized family tourism services.



\## 🚀 Key Objectives

\* \*\*Historical Analysis:\*\* Track tourism growth trends in Egypt over the last decade (2015–2025).

\* \*\*Demographic Profiling:\*\* Analyze the spending habits, age distribution, and nationalities of young travelers.

\* \*\*Market Validation:\*\* Quantify the "KidRa" target audience—currently validated at \*\*1.88M potential visitors\*\*.

\* \*\*Behavioral Insights:\*\* Identify seasonal travel preferences and preferred destinations (e.g., Cairo, Luxor, Aswan, Hurghada) among families.



\## 📊 Dataset Overview

The project utilizes two primary data sources:

1\.  \*\*Egypt Tourism Dataset:\*\* A detailed record of 10,000+ tourist profiles including:

&nbsp;   \* Age, gender, and nationality.

&nbsp;   \* City visited, trip duration, and season.

&nbsp;   \* Total spending and travel company.

2\.  \*\*Historical Growth Data:\*\* A curated timeline of visitor stats from 2015 to 2025, showing a recovery trend from 930k visitors in 2015 to a projected 1.88M in 2025.



\## 🛠️ Tech Stack \& Methodology

\* \*\*Language:\*\* Python 3.12

\* \*\*Libraries:\*\* \* `Pandas` \& `NumPy`: For data cleaning and structuring growth trends.

&nbsp;   \* `Matplotlib` \& `Seaborn`: For generating line charts and proportion-based pie charts.

&nbsp;   \* `Scikit-Learn`: Utilized for predictive modeling and spending analysis.

\* \*\*Processing Pipeline:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Data Collection:\*\* Gathering 10 years of historical stats.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Data Cleaning:\*\* Managing categorical variables and scaling spending data.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Visualization:\*\* Creating "Total Children Visitors" proportions for key cities like Luxor and Aswan.



\## 📈 Key Insights

\* \*\*Market Gap:\*\* Analysis indicates that while children constitute a significant portion of visitors to historic sites, dedicated services are lacking.

\* \*\*Spending Trends:\*\* Younger tourists often visit for longer durations (8-10 days) during peak seasons like Spring and Summer.

\* \*\*Regional Focus:\*\* Luxor and Aswan show a specific demographic split where children account for approximately \*\*30% of total visitor traffic\*\*.
